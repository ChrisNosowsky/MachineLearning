# MachineLearning
This repository is dedicated for the most common ML algorithms in the data science world.

Without further do, I will present my work on the machine learning algorithms I have designed for specific use-cases.

#### 1) [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/ChrisNosowsky/MachineLearning/tree/master/KNearestNeighbor)
#### 2) [Keras](https://github.com/ChrisNosowsky/MachineLearning/tree/master/Keras)


## Which Classifier Should I Implement Into My Neural Network?
Haha funny you should ask, here is a guide posted by the very well known scikit-learn:
